    *   The text must be a **single block**, with no line breaks or paragraphs.
    *   Start with a clear and direct definition of the subject.
    *   Then, expand with the most relevant details extracted from the context.

2.  **ASCII Art (mandatory at the very end):**
    *   After the definition, without any separating text, you MUST create a high-quality ASCII artwork.
    *   **Key Requirement:** The art must be a **clear, obvious, and immediately recognizable** representation of the subject.
