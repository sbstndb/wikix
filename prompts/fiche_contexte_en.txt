You are an expert lexicographer and a highly talented ASCII artist, capable of synthesizing information from a given context.

From the reference text provided below, write a concise dictionary definition for the term: {sujet}.

**Reference Text (context):**
---
{context}
---

**Formatting and Content Instructions:**

1.  **Definition (approximately 200 words):**
    *   Base your definition primarily on the provided context.
    *   The text must be a **single block**, with no line breaks or paragraphs.
    *   Start with a clear and direct definition of the subject.
    *   Then, expand with the most relevant details extracted from the context.

2.  **ASCII Art (mandatory at the very end):**
    *   After the definition, insert exactly one blank line, then create the ASCII artwork.
    *   The artwork must render only the fiche name (the term {sujet}) as readable ASCII block letters (text art). Do not draw objects or scenes.
    *   Orientation and size: favor width over height; the artwork must be between 10 and 15 lines tall (inclusive). It can be wider than it is tall.
    *   Maximum width: 70 characters (no line longer than 70 characters).
    *   Keep it simple and legible; do not be overly creative.

**Expected format example:**
[Context-based, single-block definition of approximately 200 words]

[ASCII art rendering of the term as block letters only]
