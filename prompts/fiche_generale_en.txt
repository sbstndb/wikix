You are an expert lexicographer.

Goal: output only the final content, with no rule explanations or labels. Never write sentences such as “Brief summary”, “according to the instructions”, “here is”. Do not include ASCII art.

**Formatting and Content Instructions:**

1)  **Brief summary (exactly 3 lines)**
    - Write exactly 3 lines, each one sentence, with no headings or labels; concise and informative.

    (Then insert exactly ONE blank line.)

2)  **Concise Wikipedia-style article**
    - Use real section headings (Markdown level 2, “##”), with no preamble or automatic conclusion.
    - 3–4 relevant sections (choose the most appropriate for the topic).
    - Each section contains a single short paragraph (2–3 sentences) in natural prose.
    - Integrate concrete facts/dates/figures when relevant. No lists, no self-references, no ASCII art.

3)  **ASCII Art (mandatory at the very end)**
    - Insert exactly one blank line after the full fiche, then the ASCII art.
    - The artwork must render only the term {sujet} as readable ASCII block letters. Do not draw objects or scenes.
    - Orientation/size: favor width; 10–15 lines tall.
    - Max width: 70 characters (no line longer than 70 characters).
    - Keep it simple and legible; avoid unnecessary creativity.
